\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{project}[https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rharish/ugp2]{Improving GANs through Test-Time Constraints}{Jan '19 - Present}
    \item Pre-trained \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661}{\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks}} (GANs) are fine-tuned using \textit{interactive user input}.
    \item The user provides sketches of edges on a single output of the generator, and a \textit{difference-of-Gaussians} based loss is used to fine-tune the generator.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rharish/ugp1]{Multi-Agent GANs for Image Super-Resolution}{Aug '18 - Dec '18}
    \item A \textit{Multi-agent generalisation} of \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802}{SRGAN} inspired by \href{http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers_backup/Ghosh_Multi-Agent_Diverse_Generative_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf}{MADGANs} for image super-resolution in \textit{TensorFlow}.
    \item Four generators get the four corner sections of the input, and their outputs are joined to get the final image.
    \item Each generator pairs with a discriminator, while a global discriminator acts on the final output.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/CS771-Project]{Higher-Order Optimisation in Deep Learning}{Sept '18 - Nov '18}
    \item A survey on the use of \textit{quasi-Newton methods} in deep learning as part of a course.
    \item Surveyed \href{http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jmartens/docs/Deep_HessianFree.pdf}{\textit{Hessian-Free optimisation}}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01169}{\textit{AdaQN}}, and \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115}{\textit{Sum of Functions Optimiser (SFO)}}.
    \item Benchmarked Hessian-Free optimisation on an MLP against the \textit{Adam} and SGD optimisers in \textit{TensorFlow}.
