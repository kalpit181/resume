\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/CS335A]{Compiler for Golang in Python}{Jan '19 - Apr '19}{Prof. Amey Karkare, CS335A Course Project}
    \item Developed a compiler for translating Golang to MIPS written in Python as part of a course.
    \item Implemented basic C-like features like data types, variables, expressions, control statements (if-else, switch, loops), arrays, functions, pointers, structs, library imports, and I/O.
    \item Implemented advanced features like composite literals, struct embeddings, typedefs/aliases, operator overloading, multiple value returns, multiple parallel assignments, short declarations, and short-circuit evaluation.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/CS330-Assignments]{GemOS - Operating Systems Development}{Aug '18 - Nov '18}{Prof. Debadatta Mishra, CS330A}
    \item Developed an object-store FUSE filesystem for storing files inside a single directory.
    \item Implemented process scheduling and swapping, context creation, sleeping, and signal handling for GemOS.
    \item Implemented syscalls for writing \& expanding/shrinking memory, and handlers for page faults \& divide-by-zero.
    \item Implemented virtual memory and paging using a 4-depth radix tree page table.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://nfcl.pythonanywhere.com]{No-Frills Cab Locator - Android App}{Sept '18 - Nov '18}{Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava, CS252A Course Project}
    \item A one-button-touch cab service with apps created using the \href{https://ionicframework.com/}{\textit{Ionic framework}} for Android as part of a course.
    \item Developed separate customer and driver apps using \textit{Angular2} in Typescript and \textit{Sass} for styling.
    \item Setup a slim \textit{Django} server to find nearest drivers, with an SQL database to store available drivers.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rharish/ugp2]{Improving GANs through Test-Time Constraints}{Jan '19 - Present}{Prof. Vinay Namboodiri and Prof. Chetan Arora}
    \item Pre-trained \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661}{\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks}} (GANs) are fine-tuned using \textit{interactive user input}, inspired by the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03552}{iGAN} paper and the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09796}{Exploiting Test Time Evidence to Improve Predictions of Deep Neural Networks}.
    \item The user provides sketches of edges on a single output of the generator, and a \textit{difference-of-Gaussians} based loss is backpropagated through the generator to fine-tune the generator's weights.
    \item A regularisation term in the loss prevents the weights from deviating away from the weights learned initially.
\end{project}
