\section*{Internships}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0mm]

\item \begin{project}{Research Intern, NYU Tandon}{May '19 - July '19}
    \item Researched robust image hashes that are immune to typical image transformations, while being sensitive to malicious image edits such as face swaps \& deep fakes.
    \item Developed a \textit{framework} for testing against compression, contrast changes, gamma, blurring, warping.
    \item Tested the networks against \textit{adversarial attacks} such as \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572}{\textit{FGSM}}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083}{\textit{Projected Gradient Descent}}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04248}{\textit{Boundary Attack}}.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/Plasticity-Networks]{Research Intern (Remote), NYU Tandon}{May '18 - July '18}
    \item Researched \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464}{\textit{differentiable plasticity}} for \textit{domain transfer} in images using Convolutional Neural Networks.
    \item Improved \textit{efficiency} in the temporal update rule for the \textit{Hebbian weights} by using \href{http://www.matthewzeiler.com/pubs/cvpr2010/cvpr2010.pdf}{\textit{transpose convolution}}.% for convolutional layers.
    \item Achieved improvement in classification accuracy, when adapting models from the SVHN dataset to MNIST.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}{Intern, Machine Learning Team, New York Office of IIT Kanpur}{May '17 - July '18}
    \item Developed an \textit{online} text clustering model using a \href{https://github.com/cloudwalkio/ddbscan}{fully-online modification} of the \textit{DBSCAN} algorithm.
    \item Implemented an \textit{online} document vectorisation model using \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053}{\textit{Distributed Memory paragraph vectors}}.
    \item Deployed above models using Docker and integrated with existing infrastructure using Apache Kafka.
    \item Developed a \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781}{\textit{Word2Vec}} model to identify duplicate documents using \href{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.html}{\textit{Word Mover's Distance}} on word vectors.
    \item Trained a CNN with sliding windows for English OCR.
\end{project}
